# Progress: Healthcare Translation Web App with Generative AI

## Completed
- Defined project requirements and specifications
- Created memory bank documentation structure
- Outlined technical architecture and approach
- Identified key technologies and APIs to use
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Created basic project structure with components
- Implemented responsive UI layout
- Created language selection functionality
- Built speech recognition component using Web Speech API
- Implemented text-to-speech functionality
- Implemented translation service using Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct via GitHub Marketplace.
- Created dual transcript display
- Fixed hydration errors caused by browser extensions
- Implemented client/server component separation for Next.js
- Added error suppression for browser extension conflicts
- Optimized OpenAI prompts for medical terminology
- Implemented cost-saving measures (caching, lightweight model)
- Added API key warning for better user experience
- Developed multi-device communication plan
- Set up Git version control and pushed initial commit to GitHub
- Fixed speech recognition start/stop issue caused by incorrect useEffect dependency
- Implemented Doctor/Patient role assignment and two-participant room logic:
  - Created modal for name/role input on room creation.
  - Updated Firebase `createRoom`, `joinRoom`, `leaveRoom` functions for role logic.
  - Integrated role display and leave functionality in `TranslationApp`.
  - Prevented new users from joining rooms that already had two participants.
- **Implemented browser compatibility check on Home screen (`components/Home.tsx`)**: 
  - Checks for Web Speech API support and specific unsupported browsers (e.g., Edge).
  - Displays a modal informing users of the requirement for Chrome.
  - Disables room creation/joining if the browser is unsupported.

## In Progress
- Enhance Dual Transcript Display for Dynamic Communication
- Final Testing & Refinement (Will occur after transcript enhancement)
- Researching best practices for WebRTC and Firebase Realtime Database (ongoing as needed)

## Planned Next
1.  **Clean up `TranslationApp.tsx`**: Remove redundant browser check logic.
2.  **Dynamic Transcript Enhancement** (Phases 1-4 outlined below).

### Dynamic Transcript Enhancement
#### Phase 1: Data Structure for Conversation Turns
- Define/refine state structure (`ConversationTurn[]`) to hold speaker details, original/translated text, language, etc.
- Ensure Firebase transcript listener provides necessary data (UID, text, lang) to populate this structure.

#### Phase 2: Dynamic Rendering in Dual Panels
- Update `TranslationApp` render logic to iterate through `conversationTurns`.
- Panel 1 (Left): Display viewer's original text or other's translated text.
- Panel 2 (Right): Display viewer's translated text or other's original text.
- Add speaker labels (You/Doctor/Patient + Name) to each turn in both panels.
- Implement auto-scrolling.
- (Optional) Add visual cues like highlighting or background differences.

#### Phase 3: State Management and Synchronization
- Update `handleTranslation` to construct and save the full `ConversationTurn` object locally and to Firebase.
- Update `listenToTranscripts` callback to correctly process incoming data into the `conversationTurns` state.

#### Phase 4: Testing
- Test back-and-forth conversations with different languages.
- Verify panel contents, speaker labels, real-time updates, and scrolling.

### Deployment & Documentation (Was Phase 5)
- Deploy to Vercel
- Create simple documentation for demonstration
- Prepare test cases for showcasing functionality
- Final quality assurance

## Blockers
- Limited time constraint (48-hour development window)
- ~~Browser compatibility issues with Web Speech API~~ (Partially mitigated by check on Home screen; Chrome required for full features)
- Potential rate limits/costs for GitHub Marketplace Models API.
- Latency considerations for Llama 3.1 70B model during real-time use.
- Need for real medical terminology testing
- Learning curve for Firebase Realtime Database implementation - (Partially addressed)
- Testing multi-device communication requires multiple devices/browsers

## Milestones
- Project initialization and planning: Complete
- New multi-device architecture planning: Complete
- Basic UI implementation: Complete (including room creation/joining modal)
- Speech recognition integration: Complete (**Browser check added to Home screen**)
- Translation functionality: Complete (within room context)
- Text-to-speech implementation: Complete (within room context)
- Responsive design implementation: Complete (for current scope)
- Client/server architecture optimization: In Progress (Review if needed)
- Firebase integration: Complete (for room logic and roles)
- Multi-device communication: Complete (via Firebase roles/sync - UI enhancement pending)
- Testing and refinement: In Progress (Role system tested, transcript enhancement testing needed)
- Deployment: Not Started (Code pushed to GitHub)
- Demonstration preparation: Not Started

## Open Questions
- How to best demonstrate the multi-device capabilities to HR?
- What specific medical scenarios should be highlighted in the demo?
- How to ensure the real-time communication is reliable during presentation?
- Are there any Firebase alternatives worth considering given the timeframe?
