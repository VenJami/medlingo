# Progress: Healthcare Translation Web App with Generative AI

## Completed
- Defined project requirements and specifications
- Created memory bank documentation structure
- Outlined technical architecture and approach
- Identified key technologies and APIs to use
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Created basic project structure with components
- Implemented responsive UI layout
- Created language selection functionality
- Built speech recognition component using Web Speech API
- Added translation service using OpenAI API
- Implemented text-to-speech functionality
- Created dual transcript display
- Fixed hydration errors caused by browser extensions
- Implemented client/server component separation for Next.js
- Added error suppression for browser extension conflicts
- Optimized OpenAI prompts for medical terminology
- Implemented cost-saving measures (caching, lightweight model)
- Added API key warning for better user experience
- Developed multi-device communication plan

## In Progress
- Planning Firebase integration for real-time multi-device translation
- Redesigning application flow for room-based communication
- Researching best practices for WebRTC and Firebase Realtime Database

## Planned Next
### Phase 1: Setup & Core Components (8 hours)
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Configure Firebase project and Realtime Database
- Create basic UI components:
  - Home/landing page with room creation
  - Translation interface with dual panels
  - Language selector component
  - Control panel (record, stop, speak buttons)

### Phase 2: Single-Device Functionality (12 hours)
- Implement Web Speech API for speech recognition
- Set up OpenAI API integration for translation
- Add text-to-speech playback functionality
- Build language selection interface
- Create responsive UI for mobile and desktop

### Phase 3: Multi-Device Communication (12 hours)
- Implement Firebase authentication (simple anonymous auth)
- Create room generation and joining functionality
- Set up real-time data synchronization between devices
- Implement status indicators (connected users, recording status)
- Add error handling for connection issues

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (8 hours)
- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Optimize for different network conditions
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Fix bugs and performance issues

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation (8 hours)
- Deploy to Vercel
- Create simple documentation for demonstration
- Prepare test cases for showcasing functionality
- Final quality assurance

## Blockers
- Limited time constraint (48-hour development window)
- Browser compatibility issues with Web Speech API
- Potential OpenAI API rate limits
- Need for real medical terminology testing
- Learning curve for Firebase Realtime Database implementation
- Testing multi-device communication requires multiple devices/browsers

- New multi-device architecture planning: Complete
- Basic UI implementation: Partially Complete (needs updates for multi-device)
- Speech recognition integration: Partially Complete (needs multi-device sync)
- Translation functionality: Partially Complete (needs multi-device sync)
- Text-to-speech implementation: Partially Complete (needs multi-device sync)
- Responsive design implementation: Partially Complete (needs room UI)
- Client/server architecture optimization: In Progress
- Firebase integration: Not Started

## Open Questions
- How to best demonstrate the multi-device capabilities to HR?
- What specific medical scenarios should be highlighted in the demo?
- How to ensure the real-time communication is reliable during presentation?
- Are there any Firebase alternatives worth considering given the timeframe?
